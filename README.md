# BROJA-Brivariate-Partial_Information_Decomposition
This repository provides code of the experiments performed in the paper A. Makkeh, D.O. Theis, R. Vicente, *Bivariate Partial Information Decomposition: The Optimization Perspective* Entropy 2017, 19, 530-570;[doi:10.3390/e19100530](doi:10.3390/e19100530).
